        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Maine Coon is a large domesticated cat breed. One of the oldest natural breeds in North America, the breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine,[3][4] where it is the official state cat.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated cats. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback, in 2020 becoming the third most popular pedigree cat breed in the world.[7]</p>

        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>Pet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003â€“2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at > 12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.[36] A UK study found a life expectancy of 9.71 years compared to 11.74 years overall</p>
