        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>A calico cat (US English) is a domestic cat of any breed with a tri-color coat. The calico cat is most commonly thought of as being 25% to 75% white with large orange and black patches; however, they may have other colors in their patterns. Calicoes are almost exclusively female except under rare genetic conditions.</p>
        <p>A calico cat is not to be confused with a tortoiseshell, who has a black undercoat and a mostly mottled coat of black/red or blue/cream with relatively few to no white markings. However, outside North America, the calico pattern is more commonly called tortoiseshell and white.[1] Calicoes with diluted coloration (blue tortoiseshell and white) have been called calimanco or clouded tiger.[2] Occasionally, the tri-color calico coloration is combined with a tabby patterning, called tortoiseshell tabby with white. A calico-patched tabby cat may be referred to as caliby[3] or torbico.</p>

        <h2>Folklore</h2>
        <p>Cats with calico coloration are believed to bring good luck in the folklore of many cultures.[26] In Germany, the word for a cat with calico coloring is "Gl√ºckskatze" or "lucky cat". In the United States, calicoes sometimes are referred to as money cats.[27] In Japan, Maneki-neko figures depict calico cats, bringing good luck. Japanese sailors often kept a calico as their ship's cat to protect against misfortune at sea.[28]</p>
